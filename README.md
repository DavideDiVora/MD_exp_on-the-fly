# MD refinement on-the-fly
**Integrating experimental data and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on-the-fly.**
This repository contains the code and datasets developed for my MSc thesis, focused on the integration of experimental data into molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.  
The main goal is to modify **on-the-fly** the ensemble, the forward model, and the force field in order to make MD simulations more consistent with experimental observations.

## üìö Scientific context
In the literature, the refinement of molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories is typically performed **a posteriori**, that is, on trajectories that have already been generated.  
Several methods have been developed to refine the **ensemble**, the **force field**, and the **forward model** simultaneously in a post-processing step.  

The aim of this work is to build upon these theoretical foundations and implement a strategy that performs the **simultaneous refinement of ensemble, force field, and forward model on-the-fly**, during the course of the simulation itself.
